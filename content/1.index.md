#title
Welcome to MSR Workspace
#description
I've spent a lot of time learning. I've found if I can explain my new knowledge well, I retain my new knowledge longer.  If, of course, I write them down, there is the added benefit of This knowledge later or sharing it again with others.

This site is the product of eclectic interests and insights, a place to store learning and an opportunity to share it as well.

What things might end up here? We'll see, but I think the following will find their places over time.

  - Technology is a big interest.  I have no tech degrees or training but I find technology useful in so many of the things I do.
  - Faith is the core of life.  We all live by faith.
  - Family is aquired without much effort but takes lots of effort to do well. I'm always working thought thoughts about family, marriage, raising kids and caring for adult family members.
  - Coaching people through life is a great joy. I hope to include some life insights from coachng as well.

We'll see what comes, but in the mean time, he's some family photos.
