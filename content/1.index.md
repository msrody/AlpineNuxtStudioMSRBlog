Welcome to MSR Workspace
#description
I spend a lot of time learning how to do things and I've found if I can explain them well, I tend to remember them better.  There is of course the added benefit of finding them again and reaquainting myself with the things I've learned.

This site is the product of eclectic interests and insights.  I hope some of these will be useful and the rest will spark interest or encourage you that you have already learned these things.

What things might end up here? We'll see, but I think the following will find their places over time.

  - Technology is a big interest.  I have not tech degrees or training but I find technology useful in so many of the things I do.
  - Faith is the core of life.  We all live by faith.
  - Family is aquired without effort but takes lots of work to do well. I'm always working thought thoughts about family, marriage, raising kids and caring for adult family members.
  - Coaching people through life is a great joy I have.  I hope to include some life insights from coachng as well.
