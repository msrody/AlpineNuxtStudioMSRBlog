I'm not a regex guru for sure, so I search for a list of non-number characters (symbols and spaces) with the inside formula first and I replace them with with nothing, essentially removing them. Using the output of the first REGEXREPLACE formula, inside the parenthesis, we REGEXREPLACE again. This second time we look for a leading \"0\".  \"^\" represents the start of the text string or line, this is why it is right in front of the \"0\". We replace it with the country code \"62\". For my purposes this works because I know the pattern of numberss comming out of our database.
